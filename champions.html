             <h3>José Raul Capablanca</h3>
             <p style="text-align: justify">
               José Raúl Capablanca, (born November 19, 1888, Havana, Cuba — died March 8, 1942, New York, New York, U.S.),
               chess master who won the world championship (1921) from Emanuel Lasker and lost it (1927) to Alexander Alekhine.
               Capablanca learned the moves of chess at the age of four by watching his father play, and he went on to defeat Cuba’s best player in 1901.
               He attended Columbia University in New York City in 1906–07 and in 1913 joined the Cuban diplomatic service, an occupation that facilitated
               his chess career by permitting him to travel to European meccas of chess. Remarkably, in active tournament competition from 1916 until 1924,
               Capablanca did not lose a single game. He was also proficient at baseball, bridge, and tennis. Capablanca was felled by a stroke while watching
               a game at the Manhattan Chess Club and died the next day. His chess style had a deceptive appearance of simplicity; at his best, he could make
               the defeat of another master look effortless.

           <h3>Bobby Fischer</h3>
           <p style="text-align: justify">
             Bobby Fischer, byname of Robert James Fischer, (born March 9, 1943, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.— died January 17, 2008, Reykjavík, Iceland).
             A chess prodigy, Bobby Fischer went on to become the greatest chess player of all time, bagging the World Championship title along with several others.
             What made Fischer a stark superior from his fellow contestants and arch rivals was his immaculate playing skills. His innovative combination of moves
             made him a star in his own right. At the age of 13, he bagged his first world title by becoming the winner of the US Junior Championship. He went on to become
             the youngest grandmaster and the youngest ever candidate for the World Championship. In July 1971, he became the first official World Chess Federation (FIDE)
             number-one-ranked player. He remained at number one position for a total of 54 months. Going on a self-proclaimed exile, he returned to playing chess against
             Boris Spassky for an unofficial match in 1992. Though he won the same, he spent the rest on his life in exile evading an arrest warrant by the US.
             Towards the end of his career, he patented a modified chess timing system - Fischer clock and a new variant of chess called Fischerandom (Chess960).

            <h3>Garry Kasparov</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the Soviet Union in 1963, Garry Kasparov became the under-18 chess champion of the USSR at the age of 12 and the world under-20
              champion at 17. He came to international fame at the age of 22 as the youngest world chess champion in history in 1985. He defended his title five times,
              including a legendary series of matches against arch-rival Anatoly Karpov. Kasparov broke Bobby Fischer’s rating record in 1990 and his own peak rating
              record remained unbroken until 2013. His famous matches against the IBM super-computer Deep Blue in 1996-97 were key to bringing artificial intelligence,
              and chess, into the mainstream.

          <h3>Magnus Carlsen</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">

            Magnus Carlsen (Tønsberg, Norway; November 30, 1990) is an International Grand Chess Master, crowned as the sixteenth World Chess Champion.
            He was proclaimed world champion on November 22, 2013, at age 22, 11 months and 23 days, 1 with what was the second youngest champion in history after Garry Kaspárov.
            He won the title by beating champion Viswanathan Anand by 6½-3½ points (3 wins and 7 draws) in the meeting organized by FIDE in the Indian city of Madras.
            Carlsen became Grand Master at the age of 13, winning the world final to former champion GM Lanaro. In 2010 we selected the first position in the world ranking of
            the International Chess Federation.
            He was the youngest player to exceed 2800 Elo points, and to achieve the number one position in the world by achieving it at the age of 19 and one month.
            On the April 2014 list, Carlsen first managed the 2882 ​​Elo points, the highest figure of all time, surpassing the 2851 Kasparov obtained in July 1999.

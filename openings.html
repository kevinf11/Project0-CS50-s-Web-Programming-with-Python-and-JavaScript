           <h3>Ruy Lopez</h3>
           <p style="text-align: justify">
             The Ruy Lopez, also known as the Spanish gam, is named after Rodrigo (Ruy) Lopez de Segura, a Spanish bishop who analyzed this opening in his 1561 work,
             "Libro de la Invencion Liberal y Arte del Juego del Axedrez" the "Book of the Liberal Invention and Art of the Game of Chess."
             Nearly half a millennium later, the Ruy remains one of the most popular chess openings. Chess experts have come up with numerous variations,
             and a wide variety of strategic plans are available to both white and black.
             The starting position of the Ruy Lopez is reached after the following moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bb5.
             Popular lines in the Ruy Lopez include but are not limited to the Morphy defense, Steinitz defense, and the Berlin defense.
             Each of these and several other variations lead to numerous sub-variations.

         <h3>Italian Game</h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify">
           First developed in the 1600s and perhaps the oldest chess opening, the Italian game also called the giuoco piano, "the quiet game" in Italian,
           is reached by the moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bc4. It remained popular through the 19th century but today has been supplanted by the Ruy Lopez
           as white's favorite choice on the third move. In this opening, Bc4 eyes black's potentially weak f7 pawn, but over the years, improved defensive techniques
           have shown this to be less dangerous to black than Bb5. Still, the Italian game often leads to aggressive, open positions, which can be fun to play.
           This opening is still used at all levels and is quite popular among club players. Variations in the Italian game include the two knights defense and the
           Hungarian defense.

          <h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            White players who prefer a quieter, more positional game tend to prefer 1. d4 to 1. e4, after which the c4 break is the best way to play for an advantage either
            on the second move or soon after. The queen's gambit, marked by the moves 1. d4, d5 and 2. c4 is one of the oldest chess openings. This classical approach pretends
            to offer a pawn. In reality, black cannot expect to hold onto the pawn if the player chooses to capture it in exchange for a stronger center.
            Black has several options: the queen's gambit accepted, queen's gambit declined, and the Slav defense.

        <h3>English Opening</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          The English opening is a flexible choice for white. The English often transposes into openings normally seen after 1. d4,
          either exactly or with slight variations due to move order. You can also enter a "reversed" Sicilian defense if black responds with e5,
          where white is playing the Sicilian defense with an extra tempo. One well-known setup that can arise from the English opening is the Hedgehog defense.

         <h3>Reti Opening</h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify">
           The Reti opening (1. Nf3) is named after the great chess master Richard Reti. Like 1. d4 and 1. c4, the Reti also generally leads to closed positions,
           and all three moves can transpose into similar setups. One possible formation for white is the king's Indian attack.
